  <h2>How to Make Cucumber Tomato Salad</h2>
  <p>There's a lot to love about this top-rated cucumber tomato salad recipe. It's inexpensive to make using everyday
  ingredients, it's a crisp and refreshing side dish that goes with just about anything, and it has make-ahead convenience
  built right in. Let's dive into this dish and see why Allrecipes home cooks award it a solid 5-stars.</p>
  <h3>What Does a Cucumber Tomato Salad Contain?</h3>
  <p>This recipe for Marinated Cucumber, Onion, and Tomato Salad has most of the ingredients right there in the title. Cool,
  crisp cucumbers and juicy ripe tomatoes are teamed up with onions in a satisfying mix of flavor and texture. But what
  pulls this dish together is the tart and tangy salad dressing made of water, vinegar, oil, sugar, salt, and pepper.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cucumbers</strong> <p>
      Choose firm cucumbers with smooth, firm skins and no soft spots. Cucumbers lose water quickly after they're picked and
      will start to show shrinking and wrinkling if they've been in storage for too long.
    </p></li>
    <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong><p>
      This recipe doesn't specify what kind of tomatoes to use, but you'll want to choose the ripest, tastiest tomatoes you
      can find. Heirloom tomatoes have the best flavor, but unless you grow them yourself, they can be pricier than the
      everyday tomatoes from your supermarket. You can use cherry tomatoes or Roma tomatoes, too. Whichever tomato variety you
      choose, get the best you can afford because the flavor of the tomatoes play a starring role. If you do use smaller
      tomatoes, be sure to slice them so the marinade can soak in and do its work.
    </p></li>
    <li><strong>Onions</strong> <p>
      You can use any onion you like for this recipe: yellow, white, or red. Each brings a different flavor profile to the
      mix. Yellow onions are inexpensive, easy to find, and have a predictable onion flavor. White onions are a bit sweeter
      and milder than yellow onions. Red onions are a little spicier than yellow onions, and carry their bright color through
      to the salad. Sweet onions are pricier, and as the name suggests, their flavor is milder and naturally sweeter.
    </p></li>
    <li><strong>Vinegar</strong><p>
      The recipe lists distilled white vinegar, but here again you can substitute other vinegars to suit your taste. Some
      Allrecipes home cooks who made this recipe used white wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, Champagne vinegar, rice wine
      vinegar, and white balsamic vinegar.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Oil</strong> <p>
      Vegetable oil is called out in this recipe, and it's a good choice because of its neutral flavor. But you can also use
      good quality olive oil if you prefer, as some reviewers did.
